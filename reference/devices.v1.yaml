    Interact with the `'Devices Service'` API to get a list of registered devices, add or remove devices and updating existing records.

    Use this API to leverage __*CloudHome*__'s central repository of devices that will then allow users to manage home automation systems.

API Keys can be used as Basic HTTP Authentication credentials and provide a substitute for the account's actual username and password. API Keys are only available to team accounts and there is only 1 key per account. API Keys do not support scopes and have therefore access to all contents of the account.
